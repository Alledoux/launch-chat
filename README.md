## Open in WhatsApp

 - This app uses WhatsApp public api 'click to chat' feature to open a chat with any number without saving to your phone book.
 - You can create an url link that will open WhatsApp on the specified number. This is a WhatsApp feature, you don't need this app to open the link, only to create it.
